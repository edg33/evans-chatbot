Title: "Whispers in the Dark"

FADE IN.

EXT. ABANDONED CABIN – NIGHT

The wind howls through the skeletal trees. The moon barely illuminates the decayed wooden structure. 

INT. ABANDONED CABIN – NIGHT

SARAH (25) clutches a flickering flashlight, her breath ragged. Dust swirls in the air. The floor creaks beneath her hesitant steps.

                      SARAH
          (whispering to herself)
     Just grab the keys and get out...

She inches forward, eyes darting toward the old wooden table. A set of car keys glint under the beam of her flashlight.

As she reaches for them—

A FAINT WHISPER.

Sarah freezes. Her eyes widen. She spins around. Nothing.

                      SARAH
          (trembling)
     Hello?

Silence.

She exhales, shaking her head, and grabs the keys. Just as she turns—

A SHADOW MOVES behind her.

The whisper returns, louder now, echoing from the darkness.

                      VOICE (O.S.)
     You shouldn’t be here...

Sarah’s flashlight sputters, plunging her into darkness.

A LOUD THUD from the far corner. The air grows thick, suffocating.

Sarah stumbles backward, heart pounding.

                      SARAH
          (panicked)
     Please… who’s there?

The whisper turns into a guttural growl.

The flashlight flickers back on—A FIGURE LOOMS IN FRONT OF HER.

A SCREAM.

FADE TO BLACK.
