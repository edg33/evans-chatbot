Title: "A Rainy Night Confession"

FADE IN.

EXT. CITY PARK – NIGHT

Soft rain drizzles, glistening under dim streetlights. The park is quiet, except for the occasional rustling of leaves. 

Near a bench, under a flickering lamp, Jane (28) and JAKE (30) stand close. Rain droplets run down their faces, but neither seems to care.

                      JAKE
          (softly, nervous)
     You know, I've been meaning to tell you something for a while now...

Jane tilts her head, waiting. A small smile plays on her lips.

                      Jane
          (teasing)
     Let me guess… you finally learned how to cook?

Jake chuckles, shaking his head.

                      JAKE
     No, though I wouldn’t mind cooking for you.
     What I meant to say is… I love you, Jane.
     I think I’ve loved you since the day we met.

Jane’s breath catches. She studies his face, searching for hesitation—but finds none.

                      Jane
          (soft whisper)
     Jake…

A pause. Then, she reaches up, brushing a raindrop from his cheek.

                      Jane (CONT'D)
     I was hoping you'd say that.

Jake smiles, relief washing over him. He takes her hand in his, intertwining their fingers.

                      JAKE
     So... does this mean I get to call you mine?

Jane leans in, pressing a gentle kiss against his lips.

                      Jane
     You always have.

They stand there, locked in the moment as the rain falls around them.

FADE TO BLACK.
